# C++ Classes Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects focusing on classes and object-oriented programming concepts. Each project is designed to help you understand and practice various aspects of classes in C++.

## Projects Overview

1. **Basic Class Creation**: Implement a simple rectangle class with member functions for area and perimeter calculation.
   
2. **Constructor Overloading**: Extend the rectangle class to include different constructors for initializing dimensions.

3. **Encapsulation**: Create an employee class demonstrating encapsulation of private member variables.

4. **Inheritance**: Implement a base shape class and derive rectangle, circle, and triangle classes to calculate their areas.

5. **Polymorphism**: Demonstrate runtime polymorphism by storing different shapes in a shape array and calculating their areas.

6. **Operator Overloading**: Overload the + operator to add two rectangle objects.

7. **Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator**: Implement proper copying and assignment of rectangle objects.

8. **Destructor**: Add a destructor to release resources used by rectangle objects.

9. **Friend Functions**: Implement a friend function to calculate the diagonal length of a rectangle.

10. **Static Members**: Utilize static member variables to count the number of rectangle objects created.
